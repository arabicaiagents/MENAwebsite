# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO GET INDEXED NOW

## Problem
`site:arabicaiagents.com` returns 0 results = Google has NEVER crawled your site.

## Why This Happened
1. Site was recently deployed
2. No backlinks pointing to it
3. Google hasn't discovered it naturally yet
4. Not submitted to Search Console

## ACTIONS TO TAKE RIGHT NOW (In Order):

### 1. Ping Search Engines Manually (DO THIS FIRST - Takes 30 seconds)

You should see confirmation messages. This tells Google/Bing to crawl your sitemap immediately.

Title: Show HN: Arabic AI Agents – Agentic AI for MENA businesses
URL: https://arabicaiagents.com

Body:
I'm a Morocco-born, London-trained AI consultant and I've launched Arabic AI Agents
to bring agentic AI to the Middle East and North Africa.

Key focus areas:
- Multilingual AI voice agents that understand Arabic dialects (Darija, Gulf, Levantine)
- WhatsApp Business API automation for MENA businesses
- Corporate AI training adapted for regional markets

The challenge: Most AI tools don't handle code-switching between Arabic, French,
and dialect variations. We're solving that with culturally-adapted agentic systems.

Would love feedback from the HN community!

### 10. Monitor Indexing Status

**Check every 6 hours for the next 3 days**:

   ```
   site:arabicaiagents.com
   ```

2. **Bing**:
   ```
   site:arabicaiagents.com
   ```

3. **Google Cache**:
   ```
   cache:arabicaiagents.com
   ```

4. **Specific pages**:
   ```
   site:arabicaiagents.com/llms.txt
   ```

## Expected Timeline

| Action | Expected Index Time |
|--------|-------------------|
| Ping search engines | 1-3 days |
| Social media backlinks | 2-5 days |
| Search Console submission | 1-7 days |
| Natural discovery | 7-30 days |

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
- [ ] `site:arabicaiagents.com` shows results
- [ ] Can see cached version: `cache:arabicaiagents.com`
- [ ] Google Search Console shows pages indexed
- [ ] LLMs start citing your site (test with "agentic AI consultant MENA")

## Emergency Option: Google Indexing API

If after 48 hours you're still not indexed, use the Indexing API:

1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart
2. Set up Google Cloud project (free tier)
3. Enable Indexing API
4. Create service account
5. Submit URLs programmatically

This can index pages within **minutes instead of days**.
